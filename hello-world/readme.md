# Hello World

This is the most basic React application ever. All it does is render a heading on the page.

All you need to do to run this example is open up the `index.html` file in your web browser!


## Explanation

This examples creates a React component `<h1>` tag and renders it within a `<div>` with the id `root` on the page. We use `ReactDOM` to do the rendering.

There are default React components for all the standard HTML tags (like `<p>`, `<span>`, `<a>`, `<nav>`, etc...)
